ABOUT
--------------------------

PHP Project By Ron Shuff Jr.

This project pulls "public" project details from GitHub that have a "Star Gazer Count" greater than or equal to 10000.  
It can easily be modified to include more results and use authentication but since it is for test purposes only, it was 
limited to keep queries efficient and under the limits imposed by GitHub.

A public demo of this project is located at: vandygit.coheresoftware.com
